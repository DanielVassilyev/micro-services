The only thing that is noticable is that containers share the disk space with the host. IP addresses are assigned by docker in its interal network,
file system is presumably runs on the host but is isolated. The processes that are running in the containers are independent from
the processes that are running within the host. Container's uptime is different, and I could not find a viable answer why it is happening.
